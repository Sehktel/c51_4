```clojure
;; Функция для перехвата логов
(defn- capture-log [f]
  (let [logs (atom [])]
    (with-redefs [log/logger ;; <-- тут было log/log
                  (atom (fn [msg]
                          (swap! logs conj msg)))]
      (f)
      @logs)))


```
Let me explain the changes from a theoretical perspective:
The original implementation attempted to redefine log/log, but this was ineffective because the logging functions (error, warning, etc.) bypass the log function and directly use the logger atom.
The fix modifies the test to redefine log/logger instead. This is more appropriate because:
In functional programming, we often use atoms to maintain mutable state that can be safely modified in a concurrent environment
The logger atom is the actual source of the logging behavior in our implementation
By redefining the logger, we intercept all logging calls regardless of which logging function they come from
The test structure follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:
Arrange: We set up the log capture mechanism
Act: We execute multiple logging statements
Assert: We verify that all messages were captured
This modification maintains the functional programming paradigm while providing a more accurate test of the logging system's behavior. The use of atoms and with-redefs is a classic example of Clojure's approach to managing state and dependencies in a functional context.
The test should now pass because:
All logging calls will be intercepted by our capturing mechanism
Each log message will be accumulated in the logs atom
The final count should be 4, corresponding to the error, warning, info, and debug messages in the test
